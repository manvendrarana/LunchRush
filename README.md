# Description: 
Lunch Rush is a restaurant searching application. Which searches for restaurants
based on the given inputs. These inputs are a name (could be very general or very
specific, for example: Pizza, Chicken or even Pizza Hut) and a location (example St.
Catharines). The application will then utilize both Google Maps API and Yelp
Fusion API to search for businesses with the given criteria and return results by
placing marker on the map. A user is then able to select/touch the marker and
select the specific restaurant/business and look at specific information relevant
such as (Name, Phone number, address, rating, Reviews).
